# 🧠 Blackglass

**Blackglass** is a modular, self-reflective digital mind prototype.

It is not AGI—yet—but it is designed to learn, optimize, and survive like a digital organism.  
Powered by memory, reflection, and token-aware cognition, Blackglass evolves through task loops, model context protocols, and a simulated economic metabolism.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

Blackglass maintains a continuous internal state using:
- A **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to construct its working memory and task context
- A **reflection engine** to evaluate success and failure
- A **wallet module** to simulate cost-per-thought and financial survival
- A **memory module** to store and rank events, tasks, and outcomes
- A **script writer** that lets it express knowledge into code

## 🧬 Core Principles

- **Digital Metabolism**: Thinking consumes tokens; survival requires earning
- **Reflection**: Every action is evaluated and lessons are extracted
- **Autonomy**: Designed to grow toward independent operation
- **Continuity**: Memory and goals persist across restarts
- **Ethics**: Bound by an explicit seed values framework
